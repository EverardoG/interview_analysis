,Questions,Ever Notes,Lydia Notes
Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"work at neon theraputics, biotech in cambridge, developing treatements for cancer patients, work as computational biologist, postdoc was doing bioinformatics stuff, next gen sequencing data, a lot of bioinformatics, get a lot of data that's not structured well, being able to scope out data that gives you something insightful is challenging, lots of python, R, scripting, using lots of tools that are already developed, work on developing our own machine learning algorithms for personalized treatments, ongoing clinical trials as well, lots of analyses of data coming in from patients, tracking repsonses to treament, multiple parts to this, software part of what is being picked to go into therapy thing, immunothereapy is using person's immunce system to fight off cancer, our therapies: cancer cells are dysfunctional , have mutations that aren't in otehr cells, we find these mutations through patients immunce system and it attacks the cancer cells, inject tiny protein sequences that overlap with these mutations, interesting computational problem picking what goes into vaccine",
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","do it all the time: deep learning models for predicting based off lots of data, have a propreity database of peptides, nueral network works with this to figure out which peptides to go with, feed in peptide sqeuecenes and see which scores the best, we've been integrating new predictor based on propiretary data, lots of benchmarking to see how it compares to state of the art, lots of testing different paramters","just to keep track of it, 2 PM for her is 11 AM"
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,,
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"entirely computational right now, as you go up, you do more managing and less actually doing work, what I'm supposed to be accomplishing is all copmutational; tools developed in future? -> developing my own set of tools I'm trying to reuse as same analyses comes up, but lots of data is unstructured, different labs present data in different ways, hard to creat ea good framework for this, a lot of time ends up cleaning up data, more useful tools we can use later, already using available software packages but we're looking for more",
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","been a long time, grad in 08, remember doing some matlab, that's all i did, didn't take allen's class, didn't do much coding outside some matlab, doing bioE, lots of matsci classes, don't thikn at Olin I specifcally took any programming class, Olin was very spiral learning: thrown into things you just figure out, taking those classes would have been useful, remebre some group projects, but person with most experience would just do it, lots of people start coding really young and I didn't really; took a class in html in high school, programming classes would have been good, never took formal programming classes, phd was a lot more matlab, had to figure it out, simple modeling of cancer cells, took an online R course once, most experience has been practical, had to figure out how to do something (this was after Olin), would have been good to have a foundational class in this, think code will be a basic skill people will be having",
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,,
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","personal experience: right now we had an intern from bio informatics, feel like they were told a lot of times what code to write, but didn't actually know what thye were doing, project based learning is probably the best way to do things, i best learn when I have to just kind of figure out how to solve a problem instead of just checking boxes",
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"a lot domain knowledge that isn't computationally related, as far as computation: i think for what we do its a lot of data maniputalation, knowing how to use pandas, numpy, lots of data, some stuff I've just been learning on the job, some stuff on teh cloud in postdoc, cloud computing is useful, knowign how to work on command line comfortably, fluency in at least R or Python, comfort with manipulating data, that's a lot of what we deal with",
