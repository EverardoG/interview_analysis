Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"work for greendot public schools -> computational thinking specialist, previously worked for exel charter school that greendot merged with, now works with 3 washington state school, work with middle and high school teachers to bring problem solving skills from cs to other disciplines, data, decomposition, abstraction, etc -> applied to a lot of other courses, work with teachers to identify what their learning objectives are, brainstorm things to develop that cirriculum, sometimes coteach with them, -> almost never coding or programming, shouldnt bring in additional content, moreabout bringing another lens, taking complicated problemand breaking it down into pieces, lookign at algorithms that people go through, 50/50 for computers being involved, a lot of times physical models are made in science uin scratch, or create human body system using pomps and popsicle sticks",
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","make simulations or webapps to power this work, ex: fitness teaccher doing data powered kickball unit, created webapp for students to collect data real time on games, start of each class: people would pick people using stats only, simple goofy code but kids did cool stuff with it, ex: science and social studies: students learning about european colonization of Africa, made simulation/ game -> gridded map of Africa where students would take on 1 of 7 european powers and try to take over Africa, students were really competitive about it and they could step back and realize some of the implications",
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,"mostly basic web codign to support leessons and activities, ina ddition to main role: teacher evaluation and student performance reporting, made a webapp for it, mostly been web coding to spport specific one off projects and lessons, publish cirriculum online",
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"transitioning to being a full time cs teacher next year, so definitely more; ran out of money for current position, if this role were to continue, it would stay about the same, tend to dive into more coding centric things in slower part of the year, jump into larger projects when i have time, would be possible to do this woithout tech, lots of flexibility",
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","learning python in freshman year was cool, getting to apply every course to real world things, remember most making digital guitar simulation, fallout radius thing, mechE, coding work after that was in MATLAB, MATLAB expert on SCOPE team; graduated and went to Microsoft as Program Manager, mid sophomore year decided to just keep going with meche degree, volunteered with kids and teaching a lot, realized that the joy was enough to leave the high paying tech world for low paying education world, 2011 graduation",
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,"before Olin: never taken a cs course, some basic coding in high school, learned flash language, html for basic webpages, tried to learn python or js and got bored and gave up, no formal cs education, after: only program manager on team without cs degree, in charge of api on team to learn cs, took couple weeks to learn C# and js, worked a lot in Microsoft through a lot of different problems, figured it out as needed, fun aspect of constantly learning",
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","project based learning -> forced to develop softer skills as you go, not things you can teach, setting reasonable goals, deadlines, success, learning from failures. -> all this pretty well built in Olin class, those skills have helped me the most, confident in general abilities, specific coding languages and technologies force you to learn something new, there's a new CS class for AP more about computational thinking, project based test/ demonstration that you can utilize technology for cool things, not about learning specific language, learning collaboration, persistence, etc, feel like newer one exists because it attracts traditionally underrepresented people into cs, more about creativity projects, etc, it's less formal",
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"best PMs were those who were able to jump into somethign new and eb sulf sufficient enough to learn what they needed, confident enough to continue learning as they went, not needing to stop everything to learn, not scared off by new topics, constantly shuffling between partner teams, changes in schedule, learn as you go, 4 yrs at Olin prepared me well for Microsoft interview, start w/ unearned confidence at MS",
,,"i think if anything, feel like there were some times at Olin where there's too much choice, pick something not meaningful, there are things that need to be done so that you don't need the content, but push you further past your comfort zone, meaningful project goals/topics, less do whatever you want, being held accountable for aiming for a goal, a lot of most important learning comes from feeling stick",
,,"having some topic ideas would help, desnat really held to original goal, had to defend changes, other places would change goal, need persistence to work towards goal -> skill could be better built",
