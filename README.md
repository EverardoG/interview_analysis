# Interview Analysis for SoftDes Pt2

This repository is being used to analyze information from interviews conducted for my summer research project with Lydia Hodges and Professor Paul Ruvolo. We aim to take qualitative information about computation at Olin College and turn it into information we can more easily visualize. The overarching purpose of this project is to promote computational skills as part of a common literacy at Olin College and the rest of the world.
