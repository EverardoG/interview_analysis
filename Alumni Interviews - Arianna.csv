Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"2016 - nonprofit in Oakland CA -> programming for middle school students and makerspace stuff and entreprenuership, pnm scaled down to  middle school students with emphasis on making money, also working as UX designer for YouThink: started doing it at olin with no software design exp, now working in illustrator and sketch, learning what features need to be built, and designing it, also maintain website on square space, sometimes help with teacher support but not really, also included things like looking at data, but that was short lived, just left a job working at a private school, started working at Chan Zuckerberg initiaitve, working on education team, teacher support specialist, zendesk for helping teachers and training them, temporary contract 6 months long, wanted to get out of private schools, also want to move up to product or design, this is boring but I'm making the best of it (Shane is the one I started the nonprofit with)",2
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","most recently, working at szi, they use mode analytics, thrown into writing Sequel, not fun, haven't touched code asides from that in years, super easy to get back into it versus people I was onboarding with, knowing what to Google is super valuable, main skill i learned at Olin, that helped a lot, understanding how to name things, names are important, syntax are important",
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,"more of a base understanding as computation that i use, understand what works and doesn't work, they're all trying to use technology but they don't understand it, and being that extra layer of protection between users and engineering team is ipmortant, keeping them from working on things that aren't feasible, having doen it, I know that i can, makes me more confident, if I have to do it, I'll figure it out, I hate it but I can do it; computational thinking: ""all softwares grow until they become a chat app and die"", Qthink -> we want a way for students and teachers to chat: I say use email, don't do that within the app, teacher will be like I want to do these things by clicking this button and having all these things sync -> i understand how database works, what can be pulled/ cant, how much work it takes to change a button, an extra module is a whole different things, I couldn't build it but I know the outline of it",
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"right now: very nontechnical field, won't do software unless I need money; if I stayed at a job for 20 years I would gravitate towards more computational things, looking at VR recently, think it would be cool to make apps for it",
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","took softdes with visiting professor, cranky lady, she was terrible, on a project where we mad ea webapp and use jango, i got stuck on front end team, came out of softdes without understanding much, still got an A because she gave A's to all the girls in the class, I started software engineering, dropped it comp bayes, dropped it, best experience I had was Olin JS, I was in the first class of Olin JS, first time I saw a point, it made sense, we were making things people could use, figuring out how to integrate things, it was structured in a way that was fun, they were also the cool upperclassman (teachers), working with Shane helped -> work well with him, had a software internship after 1st year at OLin, tried to learn Groovy (version of java), googling bugs was terrible, did SCOPE with Paul, still believe that he tricked my team into working with him, I wanted a design heavy SCOPE project, other poeple all had different interest, paul said they would each be doing something they were interested in, ended up on software heavy project, I was the project owner for it, making sure everything was moving, a year of people management, they were doing sprints and scrum that year, also did comprobo with Paul, that was fun and I didn't push myself to try to learn everything, last time i did any real code",
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,"before: jr sr year in hs at northeastern, did a bit of matlab visualization, very hands off, met researcher once, no one taught us matlab, did a lot of basic matlab tutorials, then tried to figure out existing code, then I had matlab as a tool on my computer, we tried to use it for a math competition, and we got an honorable mention and a scholarship; after: got a mac for the first time, everything I knew about the environment was no longer applicable; working with David and made an app, little bit of coding there",
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","starting with knowledge is nice, it goes against Olin's thing, but that's where the failure was for me in computing, for almost every software related calss was follow these instructions to get set up, and felt like it was a great start, but i didn't understand any of it, if you leave the computational space, knowledge is more ipmortant than skills, I should have learned the skills, then knowledge, but knowledge in intro would be nice, workforce related knowledge would be nice, I don't know how communications or structure works at a deeper level than they interact, I felt like that was missing transitioning from school to work: think it's starting to look similar for compmanies, having design be heavily involved in software development is becoming important, hfit was good (human factors interface design)",
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"willingness and bravery to jump in is ipmortant, which translates into tech literacy, when we were planning to hire people we were looking for someone who could roll with the punches, very olin mentality that's hard to find else where, you don't get to have someone hand hold you through a job that requires computing, you can always ask questions but through reviews rather than collaboration or pair porgramming: that exists but not from what I've seen it, resourcefulness and willingness to figure things out",
,"David Gaynor, Andrew Heine, Kelsey Breezeman, Tim Ryan, Chris Lee, Andy Berry, Andy Peffin","list of people: david gaynor, andrew Heine, creating a start up: bringing remote cs classes to students, they can video chat w/ people while they're struggling, they've been working on that for 2 years, I will tell them that they should talk to you, would also talk to kelsey breezman, she wasnt comfy with computing, she self taught, Tim Ryan, Chris Lee (student)",
,,"talk to Andy Berry: summer course to teach students intro to EE, and Andie Peffin: teacher always thinking about better ways to improve things",
