Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"work for facebook, been there since April, I am a software engineer, team i work on does deployment software for internal facebook tools, we figure out how to deploy tools within facebook, software tools for software engineers, before: worked at Athena Health, I was a software engineer there, working on issues management, that was super fun, that was the one stop anytime something went wrong, we would decide whether it was documentation, a real problem very rewarding",
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","all of our work is metrics driven, want to know if what we're doing is the right thing -> are we making things better?, write code every day, yesterday: spent a lot of times looking at outputs of someone esle's work to figure out why something didn't employ properly, turns out they had told machien to do something else whilel deploying, graphing what  a machine is doing, logging what's happening; there a bunhc of ways to debug, we write unit tests for everything, we do a lot of debugging with running code locally, lots of debug comments, print out every other line what's going on,",
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,"looking at graphs every day about whats up and whats down, understanding when we're hitting metric thresholds, at what point is there a problem, understanding spikes, trying to find them early, some of the things we look at, today I worked on a script that reads config files and then updates database, why we need to have both no one knows, this script keeps them in sync, I spent the day running it on dumby data until it worked; troubleshooting a lot of others' code, understanding why someone did something esle, and figuring out best to do despite the problems",
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"more: because I figure the only way to go is up: more precise product as we go, want to know things earlier, want to explain what's going wrong with more detial, better logging, nbetter mainteneance",
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","only took req programming calss, but all math and sci ended up being computational, ending up solving a lot of things through computation beyond the realm of math, most work at olin was simplifying real world problem and simulating it, grad school: applied that in the real world and in SCOPE, got to compare simulations to real world, andit was very physics heavy, every physics class at Olin was eventually writing scripts, applied to athena with matlab as programminglang of choice, mostly used matlab for things at olin, matlab is great for graphing",
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,"after: grad school was similar, EE for wireless signals, using it for really hard maht, did some sys admin type stuff at Olin, logging people into computers, cleaning up machines, setting up clusters -> hadook had just been made open source, so we spent little money to say we have a huge cluster and it will look good; before: took a lot of classes in hs, even in elementary, had the little turtle that drew pictures, and in hs took all compjuting classes, had enough by Olin",
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","languages are super useless, concepts are the same and you just remember weird details, doesn't matter what you teach in, figuring out how to write an algoirithm, knowing how to debug code and understand it less useful: specific languages, specifc algorithms, never used them, or would just google what algorithms optimizes a iven thing",
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"really the people skills are more important than anything else; that's a weakness in the computing world, knwoing how to read code and understand it because nobody documents anything, you'd think that they are but they aren't, have to read code and dig through at any company, our code is written in half a dozen languages, don't get caught up in those little details",
,,"went to grad school not having a great experience, not self directed, then got to job that was very prescribed, then wanted more self directed work once I understood what i needed, if I had learned some of that at Olin that would have been good, but soem people just learn it in the workforce",
,,"i think something i would want: anybody that goes into enterprise software will be surprised that anything already works, great to know how to debug, stick with problems",
,,"really about thinking through things and being able to solve problems, even today people don't have software backgrounds, person I sit next to is a lawyer, but one day he decided to becomem a software engineer, it's about the problem solving mindset, that's really what code is for, I know what I need to do, I just need something to do it quickly",
,,"computational makes sense as a useful skill, I support it -> valueable for everyone? wouldn't know about everyone in the world, but valuable skill for anyone doing mental work, whether its a science or liberal arts or soemthing like that, understanding logic flows are critical in any mental work, knowledge workers",
