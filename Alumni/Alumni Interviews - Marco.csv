Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"community 06 OLin, e w/ proudct design and dev, workign in educational software space, last 6 years at eDx, college courses online for free, really small when joined edX, joined engineering team as designer, writing code, getting things live, transitioned into PM role, now officially fully a Project Manager, but no longer write code or review pull requests, more just product management",
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","a bunch of av testing on where and how do we charge learners for course content, talked alot about datasets, experiments, confoudning variables, lots of tests on revenue tests, reviewing thinking and logic, unwrapping confusing things and how to figure things out with futher experiments, design lead for mobile apps -> exporting data to google sheets thing that visualizes all this data, project mangament > need to be able to tell astory > what is the most valuable and why? > needs to be backed by data, data processing, usage, filtlering, not quite the same thing as scripting, not everyone runs commands queries eetc to get that same outcome as project managers",
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,,
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"less computational -> say that because maturity level of data visualization is pretty weak, it's way better than 5 years ago, not comparable, there's such a dirivng need to support Pm role, need to make higher level synthetic decisions, less data for me, tools are just evolving very rapidly, et pinged when projections are out of line, less manual munching, more usage, data scientists -> only gonna grow, gonna get a lot of data analyst, tools will start doing what data analysts do",
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","came to olin knowing nothing about programming, took a 2cr course w/ Allen Downey for getting started, 2 cr on top of 16 cr, didn't finish class, meche on paper, our equiv of modsim was called integrated course block, calc meets mechanics, studios, simulations, lots of MATLAB, first exposure to computing, took Software Design -> had to meet requirement, but already knew how to make software, start ups-> hired handful of Oliners running a lampstack, learned it to train Oliners, worked with younger students, built facebook app, more software systems work, computing was at the beginning, tacked on softdes at the end for req, made it work from learning objective standpoint because of open ended project",
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,,
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","A lot of pedagogi hidden in textbook manifesto, framework → a lot of textbooks represent basic knowledge and content, eventually you wind up being able to package that into shared language/ concept, like the idea of a loop, you could easily replace think python with anohter language, that’s a hard way of teaching, measure of succes for content for high rate of transfer → concept is clear, application is pluggable, you get to shared language fast, you can walk around Olin and say “iteration of project” → weird thing to say outside of software, cs when taught well by being grounded on concept, you get to shared language quickly, most courses you get through a ton ofk nowledge in discrete units, needs to build in a way that you’re doing something much faster in the middle of the course than you would have done it when you started, model that you can cover basics of computer programming in an hour, take learner from concrete to abstract, go up the stack to abstraction, this concept makes sense with other things, like classifaction system for animal systems -> animal kingdom is all connected and you can connect it all visually, this concept is simple enough that you can get to the perspecteve (concept), or you can get them to memorize some nonsense, and they won't remember the concept",
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"in computing space: 3 things they can't do-> ability to contribute to existing code, ability to modify live environments (improve current live running software system)/ modify a real thing not a new thing, (look up 3 classic cs pitfalls), probably something about communication for the last one, this separates new hires, ",
,Other:,"some of the best work being done in the space of knowledge vs skills -> 4 dimensional education, author is part of Olin's speical counsel thing",
