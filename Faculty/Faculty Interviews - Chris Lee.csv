How computing intersects with their field,How would you describe your field?,"mechanical engineering, my area would be structural dynamics",
,How has computing intersected with previous jobs?,"jobs: engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, prev: substantial part of work, some level of computation was involved typically, we did  high fidelity physics simulations of buildings, machines, etc, lots of experimenets to take data, processing involved lots computations, lots of handling lots of data, turned it into useful info, MATLAB to programs that you wrote yourself",
,What background do you have with computing?,"when I learned computing, itwas fortran, use it for solving equations, don't write info type things, at hte time, most of the codes were written in fortran, that was a common language, used matlab version 2 on pc, no hard disk, checked out matlab on a floppy disk, went to ibm pc, stuck in disk, did matlab off the disk; started in college, freshman year of college learned, it was there in hs, but it was standard in college, in graduate school there were unix work stations and other stuff",
,What did you learn in your education relating to computing?,"aside from fortran, numerical methods, how to implement numerical algorithms, solving ODE",
What computing they have students do in their classes that they teach,What classes do you teach/ have taught?,"modsim, desnat, POE, mechanics solids, dynamics, mechanical and areospace, energy harvesting, QED, SCOPE",
,How have you utilized computing in those classes (if applicable)?,"dynamics -> matlab solving ODEs and doing linear algebra, philiosophy is to get people to use simulations to understand the physics, computation is the best way to do that, mechsolids -> material has less need for solving things you cannot do by hand,it's more conceptual and simple, more algebraic stuff, we look at something like a 1d rod, which we can solve as a DE, math necessary does not require numerical solution, unless you were doing cimplest case, you end up with linear differential equations that can't be solved by hand; the idea is matlab is a calculator, you have to write in a series of commands, but I wouldn't say it's actually computing",
,What computing skills would you like your students to have going into your classes?,"dynamics -> more matlab experience they have, the better, skills are not particularly advanced, in this class we do very basic things with it, run a function and plot, write a function and access it; want people to leave with comfort using matlab, that's exactly what you need, whatever language is fine, I cant help but it doesn't matter what platform, matlab is just very common, octave is like matlab but open source",
,"Where in your class would you like to utilize computing, but don't? What's keeping you from doing so?","lots of computing in there already, it's pretty good right where we're at; some electives have some times where we do things that you need to do dynamics thins, answer is yes there, i do a very narrow thing in computing",
,,"say someone says I'm interested in bio, so if I was teaching that, all your biology would look like mass on a string, need speical people to bring in skills, the current idea sounds interesting, some way you need to balance general skils and applying them in specifc area, you learn a a lot quicker by working on a specific problems, thinking about how its structured, how do students interact with material? computing is really broad, talk to 10 faculty and you get 10 versions, as you get more and more specialized it's harder; they could do this all on their own, but for more structured experience, we should figure out how to get that to happen",
,,"aerospace -> flutter instability, might have seen videos of it, have a structuer that's in an air flow that begins oscilliating, essentially strucutres sucks energy from air and gets large amplitude, then breaks, so there's alot of design that goies into avoiding fluttering, so there's a whole range of computational models from simple to very complicated",
,,"some percieve modsim as programming class, didn't learn math and physics, learned programming, was more of a modeling class with programming, trying to figure out how to define that clearly, they understand what they're getting into",
,,"dont want class focused on making program work, want to teach other things, how people get code to work is hard, have to take that into account, have to figure out a way to deal with it, don't know if that's the case in more E w/C classes, do know in classes like dynamics, a big block of pain comes from just executing code",
,,"another thing faculty is doing: analysis stream: look at all olin curriculum and have a stream of analysis vs a design stream, modsim would be first class in this stream, potentially a class you are describing could fit in analysis stream, this is separate from research stream, next fall there'll be research methods class, look at it in terms of computing -> good model to look at",
