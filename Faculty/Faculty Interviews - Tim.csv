How computing intersects with their field,How would you describe your field?,"before Olin: creative director and graphixc designer, now I am focusing on teaching and developing visual communication for clearly and effectively communicate to multiple audiences","before olin, creative designer/graphic deisgner; at olin, teaching and developing visual communication"
,How has computing intersected with previous jobs?,"before: people using processing power of computers to crunch data and create data, my job has been to make it more approachable or understandable, i make the data more approachable or understandable, like with visual graphs and stuff, or showing opinions or information a certain way, I can be a couple steps removed from the computing in a lot of what I do, I've also worked on interfaces for websites or web products that people who use computing are using; position where you could've used crunching of your own data: one of those things that I don't think that I need cause I don't have experinece with it","computing -- people using processsing power of computers to create and process data, job has been to make it more approachable and understandable (the results of the data). Has also worked on interfaces for web sites/web products. Doesn't usually think about it, since it's something he doesn't really know"
,What background do you have with computing?,"used to write action script: code for flash, used to work at a plce called tank in boston that was a consulting place where I did a lot of design work, last year: mostly doing interactive coding in flash, quite a bit of work for fedex where we want peopel to understand their product, i made tutorials for this, for tank: build a website from scratch, so I would build backend of website; a little bit of html and css; i design websites from time to time in freelance, this summer I'm designing a round 1 design for an olin project, not part of my project description but I might work on it for a project; w/ coding: aciton script was not a good thing for me to keep doing because I wasn't super good at it, while other people were, this was super helpful for me: as a creative director, I had a lot of people work for me and it was super helfpul for me to konw what's possible""This is like a half hour change or this is going to take them a week ebacsue they have to hcange the whole website"", its such a normal part of our culture now to build a website, websites are changing so quickly, so you can go to like square space, and make a quick nice website, but tere's an expectation that oyu should know how to code; for me it was nice because I could not get ripped off, knowing a little bit helps me call out people trying to rip me off","No (I don't think so); used to write Action Script (Flash); worked for Tank in Boston -- designing websites, interactive coding in Flash. Super hard for him, that's why he doesn't do it any more. Knows some html and css. Does web work as freelance, so still does it every once in a while if a project comes up. Wasn't worthwhile for him to stay in that area, so it's good he moved on, but it's helpful for him to know what was reasonable and could be done and what would take a long time to accomplish. Doesn't know if it's something people are going to continue to do, since there's a lot of tools for creating a web site without touching the code. Knowledge is also good for not getting ripped off; a little more confidence"
,What did you learn in your education relating to computing?,"Im like 8 thousand years old: there was no internet when i was in college, I learned nothing about computing in school, but I taught myself html, and then taught myself action scripting, I was the only person who did it in my studio, anything i knew about copmuting was from forums online","no internet when in college, didn't learn anything in school; taught himself html, taught himself Action Scripting"
What computing they have students do in their classes that they teach,What classes do you teach/ have taught?,"design nature, tell the story of what you make, return design which is now turning into now my research position, won't be a class moving forward, gonna teach UOCD","DesNat (supposedly the website will look good!), tell the story of what you make, have taught return design (will not be a class anymore, will just be his research from now on), will be teaching UOCD in the Spring (YES!)"
,How have you utilized computing in those classes (if applicable)?,"tell the story: not sure this counts: have a friend who supports faculty with technology, helps with canvas and stuf like this, for the past 10 years hes been working on a managament system that I use for teh tell the story, so I've been consulting him about design, used evernote, then swithced to mediacron, not doing the computing, but I am looking at platforms to see what would work best; return design: mini design studio, as a result: processes can be fairly different from eachother, people can communicate things visually differently, we did a whole visual presentation at the whitehouse, last semester presentation project for org on west coast: designing new methods of sword fishing that have much less by catch, they got funding from govt, they had trouble getting more support because it seemed like long lining, but it was very different, it was unclear, so we made one graphic for them highlighted differences between their thing and long lining, big physical thing vs one slide that helped them get their funding, working with scott right now on ultra fine particles (particles you cant see taste or feel) -> they can cross blood brain barrier and infiltrate body in ways we haven't thought about, main researcher wrote a book on it so research is accessible to people, but you would have to be at least a doctoral student to access the book -> we want to reach out to ordinary people so that level book doesn't work, we're helping him turn that data into soemthign appropriate for like a billboard, we've done a bunch of ideation for this, anything from photoshoots to taking heavy data and turning it into infographics that are easy to digest quickly","tell the story of what you make -- friend that is a tech support for faculty, Tim uses a tool that his friend has made and they've been talking (mediachron?) about it's design, so he's not coding but his friend is. DesNat -- working with the worst website ever... Return Design -- mini design studio, projects can be fairly different from eahc other; all dealing with visual communcation. first helped design and build a presentaion booth for Sarah Hendron. last semester did a presentation project for org on West Coast designing new mothods for sword fishing. It looked like something illegal (long lining), but it was much different, so the class spent a semester creating a graphic that showed the difference and helped them continue to et funding. Some else is working on ultrafine particles, coming up with crazy data sets, but they don't know how to present that to everyday people, so Tim is helping them with that; making something good for a billboard or poster in China Town"
,What computing skills would you like your students to have going into your classes?,"i sort of adjust to what ive got for student skills, basic html and css is super helpful, everybody can sort of do squarepsace, but i have found that people who feel comfortable taking a template and change it how i want is super helpful, i can figure out, but i usually don't have the time since i'm doing higher level stuff, so much more gets done if students have a basic comfort level with css and html, if i have students who can do backend stuff, its super helpful and we just do better projects, we had one student who took these animal trading cards and created a web app that would allow you to make your own look look cards, it let us go to schools and tell peopel they can make their own and print them out, it's a great example of a computing problem, it works but has no where to live because he hosted it on his own site, it works but it's ready for round 2, like cards are saved somewhere online, it needs another semester of a computer science person to work on it, it would be an aweseom project for it, if nobody happens to do it, it might never be used, so that's an interesting thing; interesting about computing: ive heard from a num of students at olin, sick of babson student walking in saying they have an app idea assuming olin computer nerd will just make the app for them, it would be cool to have some sort of forum or place somewhere to put software ideas: like hey i need someone to work on look look and other oliners can see it and someone can come to me and say they're interested, it would be so cool to do home schooling with something like look look, it would let you hit so many awesome things; if there were 5 computational people who want something to work on and 6 projects that we professors have it would be nice fo rthem to look at them; i think lots of professors would like to ask students to do things but dont want to put students on the spot; haven't recently used comptuation in return desing for super cool interactive displays, for the most part I haven't because we've been doing more branding, communication stuff, so on, wouldnt' be opposed to peopel coming in knowing how to do it, thats totally something i could use","basic html and css is useful, the students who can go in and make tweaks to a template from SquareSpace rather than saying, ""I don't know it's got to be this size"" do really well; students who can do backend work make for better projects (web app for individuals to create their own LookLook cards), would be an awesome project if a student wants to put it through round 2 (saving the cards you make). Oliners tired of Babbies walking on campus ""hey I have this idea, you make it and just have a friend make the logo""; if he can get someone to be interested in makign LookLook better, he would be willing to help with the design, and you could even sell the cards (even to the government). Would be nice to bring together people interested in computing and people with computing projects without putting a bunch of awkward pressure on people. hasn't recently used computation for interactive projects because he's been doing bigger projects (branding, campaign marketing, etc.). If he had students come in knowing how to do it, he could definitly use it"
,"Where in your class would you like to utilize computing, but don't? What's keeping you from doing so?","examples: part of accesible icon project: follow up project ive worked on has been collection of all existing versions of wheelchair icons that are out there, we got legal pushback that we can't change the logo for the wheelchair icon becaue people wont know what it is: i want to take all the versions of teh icons and get people to understand what its liek to be in a wheelchair: I could say hey here's 10 different versions of the wheelchari icon: some look more active than the others: took 10 icons and made the standing version of you, we can all look and say would you want to represented by this stick figure or would you like to be represented by this stick figure with a normal sized head that doesn't look like a robot? we would like code that has a webapp that makes a standing version of the symbol, measure angle of body, size of the head, all that stuff, that's like a super intense computing version of it, that would be a beautiful way of showign peoople what those signs would look like; do you feel differently being represented by one over the other, things that specific come up all the time in return design: we came up with the idea of creating 12 plexiglass boxes that have foam balls flying around at the appropriate time, it helps peopel understand the difference between 5 o clock particles and 12 o clock particles","specific examples (nothing overarching) -- accessible icon project; collection of examples of all the existing wheelchair icons, wanted to take them and use them to understand how people might feel in a wheelchair; ""here's 10 different versions of the wheelchair, some of them look a little more active, how do these make you feel?""; what he did was take the ten icons and made the standing version of each of them, then checked how it made himslef and others feel. Would like to make a web tool (?) to automatically transform icons to standing versions. VERY heavy computatioanl project. Things specific like that come up all the time in return design"
,,"as far as thinking abotu students' abilities with computing as a professor, I thikn that there' sa pretty vast difference in what i think tsudents can do vs waht people teaching computing courses would think, oliners can build anything, but I don't konw who can build what: as a prof it would be awesome for me to know what students can and cant do, don't even understand most of the names of classes we have to take, that would change me for what I ask of students in class, that would be really cool for tel the story of what you make",having 2-3 students for return design is the best size because it limits the number of projects to around 3 and he can have a lot of one-on-one time with each of them
,,,"as far as thinking about student's abilites with computing as a professor, there's a vast difference between what he understands and would say versus what the computing professors would say. It would be nice to have some way for non-computing professors to understand what students can or can't do with computing; would especially be nice for tell the story of what you make"
