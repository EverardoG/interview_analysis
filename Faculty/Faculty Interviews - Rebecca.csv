How computing intersects with their field,How would you describe your field?,"applied physics, <- title, but applied physics is waht people call things when they dont know what to call them, not quite engineering or physics, do a lot of thinking of engineering problems from fundamental level, learning about how the world works, or using my fundamental pjhysics stuff to make practical stuff better, I consult at draper laboratories (QEA in teh real world), I get assigned to projects that aren't going anywhere because no one had botherd to crank through hard quantitative stuff, i throw high power computational tools to help people get unstuck, do a lot of computational stuff, simulations, not lots of coding, no making things communicate, i just write the nitty gritty what it does code, before I did matlab I used C-plot: C based same thing, you just coded math, I do math coding",
,How has computing intersected with previous jobs?,"job as a professor is to teach a lot, teach a lot of compuational stuff which is funny because I used to hate it, now i do so much of it, i do lots of data analysis for research and for other things, I don't know that there's been any project in last 20 years that I haven't used matlab for, you just open it up and start coding, less time coding it than finding a script for it, also have an archive full of code; postdoc: lots of matlab analysis of data, back in grad school: got first matlab student edition, really wimpy compared to now, mostly used C plot, didn't have to deal with file stuff, I don't consider myself a coder, I code math and always have, I think my earliest code was in 5th grade, never had research from undergrad on wihtuot computation",
,What background do you have with computing?,"school got a comoputer and I was an advanced math student so they threw it at me, I learned turtlelogo, did a little bit of computer programming in hs, sr yr, went to summer computing program that was horrible, not alot of women in computing at the time, this program at the time: nsf had quotas for funding, didn't get quota for summer program, i was alumni of prestigious math funding, they contacted me and offered me free to go to the camp, i only went for 2 out of the 6 weeks, I show up and im completely unqualified, I show up and they hand me off the buggy uncommented code of some jerk older student who wouldn't talk to me, it was buggy and uncommented with code that I didn't know, and that turned me off from it for years, I took two years of a class in C as a senior from guy who wrote the book on it, but 2 weeks in I hated it, and of course I spent my undergrad coding math",
,What did you learn in your education relating to computing?,"learned a lot of stuff not related to computing, learned some basic in elementary, through grad school taught myself some html because websites existed now, when matlab was in full steam, I;ve been coding in matlab ever since, tried python twice, not happening",
What computing they have students do in their classes that they teach,What classes do you teach/ have taught?,"QEA -> fair amount of computation, haven't taught much other than QEA recently, before QEA: taught class in E&M w/ vec calc and projects: in physics theres an interplay between mathematic proofs and applied physics side that checks that, computational domain does something closer to life, you experiment to validate everything, wanted to introduce that framework of how modern applied science works, you're gonna do some proof of concept, then you're going to learn modeling, then you make realistic picture of what's going on",
,How have you utilized computing in those classes (if applicable)?,"QEA 2 -> deeper than first semester, tool for solving problems, there reaches a point where you can write equations but you can't solve them; there's a tool in MATLAB that's used for block diagram analysis, which we'll be playing with, langragian controls system analysis, basically more of the same different mathematics, using it as a tool to push ability to understand problems; E&M: analytics backs the proof of concept -> computation fits in the middle of this, you can run things faster with simulations and you can take out the things that aren't important, experimental time is very important, want to use computation to save time",
,What computing skills would you like your students to have going into your classes?,"before: basic familiarity with fundamental matlab stuff; after QEA: a lot of what we're trying to do is teach how to set up and solve mathematical problems, not really computational thinking -> that's one way of doing it, but not the only way, in each module in the spring, we had a module breakdown phase, we have a big engineering problem, so we're gonna take it apart and figure out how we can get to quantitative questions, we did a concept map for recognizing a face, we sorted them and then created a concept map to make all the connections, and we did lots of psuedocoding for neatos, psuedo coding is problem breakdown, just one example of how to approach problem break down; most math can be approached by computation",
,"Where in your class would you like to utilize computing, but don't? What's keeping you from doing so?","I'm not sure it's possilbe, when we had Allen, part of what I hoped he would bring was a little bit of softdes into qea, wanted you guys to learn to code nicely, we've seen a lot of really bad code in QEA, good computational practices would be good so that that's not the struggle",
,,"coding as a doing anything you want to do: one of the places I've wished I had better coding skills, every year I do MIT mystery hunt, it's a massive puzzle hunt, a series of puzzles you solve as a team that lead to more and more puzzles, eventually you find a coin on campus, it's a load of fun, but puzzles are one of those things where if you can write code, you feed in a puzzle and out comes the answer, some puzzles cant be solved any other way, it's like coding in the wild, there was a puzzle on stegonagraphy that could only be solved computationally, another puzzle was a knitting pattern that was actually code, ",
