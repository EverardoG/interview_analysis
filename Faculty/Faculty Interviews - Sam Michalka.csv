How computing intersects with their field,How would you describe your field?,"computational neuroscience, study human cognition, paying attention to things, how people interact with machines, look at how people pay attention to things, measure brain signal and then try to create real time devices that translate that into some response that a computer or robot can make, then also interested in augmented reality and how humans interact with it",
,How has computing intersected with previous jobs?,"early jobs: manipulating spreadsheets, surprising amount of engineering jobs are dealing with data in that form, at least they were 10 years ago, in grad school and postdoc, a lot of what I did was analyze data, like statistics, writing scripts to optimize data, whenever you're doing something live/ online, then trying to write effecient code becomes really important; current: data analysis is  a lot of what i do, also intersects with teaching students and expect computational skills",
,What background do you have with computing?,"learned mostly on my own, I totally learned by recording visual basic and figuring out what it was writing into the scripts, did not take any programming classes, mightve been a cs major with those classes, i write a lot of code as part of what i do, but no formal training",
,What did you learn in your education relating to computing?,"learned a lot of matlab scripts in grad school, matlab was the main language when i was in school, how to organize data is super important, also how to manipulate things, how to store large datasets, how to debug, and how to write analysis that's robust and you trust to be able to troubleshoot it, what happens a lot -> you write code, analyze it, get aresult, and realize things weren't working quite right, learning to put in sanity checks to make sure results make sense, that was a key skill",
What computing they have students do in their classes that they teach,What classes do you teach/ have taught?,"ISIM, QEA 1, SCOPE, nuerotechnology: brains and machines",
,How have you utilized computing in those classes (if applicable)?,"used mathematica for modeling, i was focused on robo and face rec stuff for QEA, but mathematica is pretty similar to matlab; for robots: we used docker, that was the first year of it; SCOPE: don't teach any programming/ skills, capstone project, teams of 5ish work with company, some projects are heavily computing focused, other have essentially no computing, entirely determined by company, expectation that you come in with skills appropriate for your project or you will learn them, model for SCOPE: 4 faculty advisors, each advisor advises 4ish teams, my teams were hardware teams, al ittle bit of data anlaysis, and so they had to use those skills from a computing standpoint, one of the other teams: did a lot of computer vision work, that was a big part, one of the skills that's really useful is finding appropriate toolboxes, understanding implementation/ documentation, knowing how to find the right toolboxes is important; nuerotech: only run once, I will totally change it if I teach it again, agnostic about whether or not students used matlab or python, but i wrote things in matlab notebooks, analyzed data in that, they would have to figure out how to import data, build headers, deal with mix of text and numbers, looking at data and looking for outliers and things that are incorrect, then doing statistical analysis, we also an interface project at the end, we di live processing with python, then more data analysis, and some machine learning",
,What computing skills would you like your students to have going into your classes?,"structure of data is really helpful, understanding how to store and manipulate things, troubleshooting for sure, chekcing robustness of code; research: will take first years, but someone coming into my lab, one of the most helpful things for them: here is this script, walk yourself through it, add additional comments to it, being able to read someone else's code and breaking down what's happening to english",
,"Where in your class would you like to utilize computing, but don't? What's keeping you from doing so?","would love to be able to go deeper into some of these topics, one of the biggest challenges is the wide range of skills that students have, so even with nuerotech class, there were all juniors and seniors, there was still a really big range of computing skills and experience, as a faculty member you ahve to find middle ground, don't want people to miss out on stats part because computing is new to them, had to think alot about that ",
