How computing intersects with their field,How would you describe your field?,"that is a complicated question -> environmental engineering, so i would describe it as focusing primarily on feasibliyt and acceptiablity of aleternaitve water and sanitation technologies, olin doesn't fit neatly into environmental engineering bucket so it's complicated, but that's my primary home, that's work that I've done to date, work going forward is more sustainability; at olin; i teach primarily in spaces that have to do with sustaiblity and modeling, also run GCSP program, and I am just starting on sustainability certificate program, do standard committee work, plus sit on sustainability committee, do some things around education and equity, and also working with student's stuff: like IS, that mostly captures it",
,How has computing intersected with previous jobs?,"once spent a summer as an intern in tech company working on a digital library/ managment system, first place computing showed up strongly, then ordinary computer user stuff, then grad school: started workign more with different kinds of web services, more advanced excel modelign, more programming with geographic info services (GIFs), then kept working with excel modeling with special plugins, now I would say I use different computing tools for that modelign work, then lots of desk research with lirbary resources, that kind of thing",
,What background do you have with computing?,"have taken one or two programming classes along the way, father is EE, picked up a lot from him, never had a lot of formal training in software or programs that I use, I pick it up from colleages or teach myself, took class in undergrad: req intro cs class for civil engineer undergrads, it was terrilbe, learned basics, never took any programming class in college, sometimes stats software in grad school",
,What did you learn in your education relating to computing?,"formally: learned a little bit about data structures and algorithms and an intro to one programming language, informally: learned more programming languages, other sorts of structures and architectures, web serives, how they work/ how to use them, learned how to learn new software quickly and pick it up as I went, i've learned bits and pieces of various bits of software, gained a facility getting used to software system and mkaign stuff happen, including things like what resoruces to turn to in order tp ick up what I needed",
What computing they have students do in their classes that they teach,What classes do you teach/ have taught?,"olin: modsim, environmental analysis and science, previously called enviromental analysis + engr, sustainablity synthesis, UOCD, previously: only classroom (as ta): one on engineering comms, one on a class called projects for udnerserved communites, like engineers without borders, lots of private tutoring: a wide range of test prep, but also everything ranging from how to write 5 paragraph essay, to calc, chem physics, a little bit of history, no foreign languages",
,How have you utilized computing in those classes (if applicable)?,"modsim, particularly find it interesting to think of computation as tool, which is not always how modsim comes accross, in environmental analysis class: it was computation stuff on air project, students would get data on air quality, then analyze it in various ways, sustainabilty synthesis class used computation if project required it",
,What computing skills would you like your students to have going into your classes?,"think a level of comfort with using a computer and encoutering new software is biggest thing: not afraid to meet new software and trying to use it, being willing to deal with frustrations that go along with that, that's a learning process, some familiriaty with some programming language can be useful, in my experience once you know one, theothers are a lot easier to learn, it's a useful way of thinking, like learning a new human language, it opens up a door in how we think, because of the vast range of stuff poeple dot hat there aren't specific languages to know, for my purposes, there's no one thing students need to know, some familiarity with how programming works is good",
,"Where in your class would you like to utilize computing, but don't? What's keeping you from doing so?","i have not found myself wishing we could do some copmutation in a class and it isnt possible, do have possiblities for using different stats software for classes I hope to teach or already teahc, some of that stat analysi with software support behind it would be of interest to me; there are also a few things that I've seen people do in excel, some of the plugins they have for it work really well, not sure how I would use those things, but there's potentional for it in the future; mostly the thing keeping me from it is finding the wya to work this stuff in is too much work, separate from modsim",
,,"if we can teach people more tools or give peopel ability to figure it out that's the most useful, my perception is that people your age tend to be fairly comfortable with software but i still think there are bariers for people to jump into learning this stuff",
