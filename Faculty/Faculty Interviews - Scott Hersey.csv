How computing intersects with their field,How would you describe your field?,"i will describe two fields im at the intersection of;1. chemistry and air pollution, theoretical work behind that, lots of field measurements of things that require lots of data science2. communinty based development work, so my research questions are all driven by communities impacted by really bad air pollution, tend ot be lower income communities of color, all these neighborhoods that highways go through, there are lots of people doing advocacy, I get to knonw these people, partner with them, equip them with data and interprepetations, interpretations existing literature, theyre better equiped for advocacy and reducing exposure of pollution; sense of research: half UOCD, half analytical atmospheric chemistry",
,How has computing intersected with previous jobs?," computing is huge, in just atmospheric chem space, latest development came from computer scientist using special spectomotrometer that tells you chemical comp of particulate matter, if you find a way to look at patterns and giant sets of mass spectra, you can start to pull out source characteristics that craeted those patters, colleage does a lot of this type of analysis, work that I'm doign right now: low cost sensors, single really good instrument, go bug Leila Hopkins if you wanna see one of the enviornmental sensor boxes, great potential for machine learning to look at these datasets and use low cost metrics to identify different cases of what is the pollution like outside, if you can use robust machine learning to connect low cost measurements to high fidelity ones, you can use low cost instruments to get some similar stuff to high sophistication instruments, my SCOPE team is setting up air quality monitoring netweork with low cost sensors, goal is to democratize the data, you can get maps of air pollution in hyper local area, people have feedback about air quality and can make descisions to reduce their exposure, there's a lot of js api work, buildign front end that people can engage with that's user oriented, there's another layer which is using ml approaches to push notifications to people's phones, we can measure proxies of different air pollutants",
,What background do you have with computing?,"background: I learned enough matlab and R to do the data analysis I needed to do through grad school until now, i am now very slowly learning python, but I'm not competent in it, I lean heavily on stack overflow, i conceptually understand what things like ml tools do, know what PCA is, understand all theory and concepts behind math, don't know how to operate it, that's where i end up advising student teams with lots of computing people, I can help them think through the structured form of what theyre doing, high level stuff; opinoin on R: not enough of a computing person to give a strong opinion, I once heard R describing as like cigarettes, it's a nasty habit, but it feels good, I like that it's open source, there are really nice packages for it, there's a great air quality package in it, gonna teach enviornmental analysis class to use that specific package cause it's just really good, I've found R really effective at statistical work that wouldve been cumbersome to do in matlab, there's things like pandas in python that does a lot of the other things, R got it's whole package thign from python and pandas",
,What did you learn in your education relating to computing?,"computing is gian ocean of tools, and that from time to time you'd have to wade into that ocean and pull a tool out and figure out how to use it, then its in your toolbox, but some of those tools are hidden at greater depths than others so theyere harder to access, nobody ever taught me this, this is my experience, when I was learning computing it was in traditional engineering context where I learned to use matlab cause its just what you do; there was a single class in matlab that i took the first 3 weeks of, stopped cause it wasn't helpful, learned it on my own for a sr thesis, got a lot stronger with it in grad school, all hands on learning stuff as i went",
What computing they have students do in their classes that they teach,What classes do you teach/ have taught?,"capstones: ADE and SCOPE, and I taught UOCD last semester, teach a class w/ allison wood: enviornmental analysis and science; probably gonna teach QEA in future, Probably also modsim in future; partially reason for learning python, a lot of my field: leading edges of air quality are computing, and I am seeing more and more that computing is a strength at Olin, many students ahve some strong computing background, and it's a jgreat opp to do some great impact work in air quality space, get some strong computing students, I can be a more effective advisor by being better with python",
,How have you utilized computing in those classes (if applicable)?,"it's R in the env analysis class, give people data with past 3 yrs of data and they look for different trends using R open air package to analyze that data; its hard to do real world projects that doesn't require computing in some way, in ADE you would do data analysis with matlab, visualizing data with different figures, generating statistics, a lot in the research space, in SCOPE, we'll do a lot of web development, probably do soem data analysis work, will need some strong data peope on that team for ml",
,What computing skills would you like your students to have going into your classes?,"want people to have familiarity with python, which gets you up to speed with python really quickly, object based programming foundation, in scope: really need people good with javascript, need people who have been through data science, in the future: data science is a big thing I want students to have under their belt, I see more and more that machine learning is a hammer that hits lots of different nails, the more people have experience with ml and its limitations, it's really powerful but there are times to not use it; applied stats is soemthign i wish students had more general familiarity with, beyond r^2 fits and correlations, like making a linear regression model, where it could be helpful, what a stepwise linear regresssion can tell you about various vectors",
,"Where in your class would you like to utilize computing, but don't? What's keeping you from doing so?",think i've figured out how to utilize it where I need to,
,,"poeple struggle with computing in env sci, this is the third time running, first time students downloaded giant data files, students tht werent comfortable using python to scrub out info -> they struggled, now I try to give them better data files, students struggle the most with when data file doesn't behave like you expect it to, don't know what to do when things arent in right format, that's the bane of my coding existence, date-time vectors-> it can be painful, that's the thing that students struggle most with",
,,"first time i taught the class, mostly second years and first years, second time it was in the fall and it was mostly jrs and srs, the jrs and srs taking it were less likely to have taken softdes, they were interested in enviornmental side of things; i think more of the second year students have taken softdes",
,,"R comes with caveat that I don't know how to teach it yet, so it'll be a big experiment, had a student help me think through how to teach it, I did not teach centered on any language before, you can use whatever works for you; had mixed results with that; some people used matlab, had better ersults with python likely because those people already had programming expeirence, it'll be an experiment, I've played enough with package that I knoew what to expect from it, there's a kickass 500 page manual and Im excited to see what students pull out of that manual",
,,"javascript is big missing piece in computing we offically have at olin, and it would be really really valuable, a lot of what happens in javascript, our students who are most competitive are the ones who already have soem javascript who did stuff outside of coursework because we don't have courses centered on that, js seems liek experience that would benefit our students a lot, i feel like ml would also be good for students, would love to see course focused on theory of ml, ml and js help you be competitive in the workplace, that's stuff that also Im keen to have students that have experience with that for my own research, teh leading edges of env sci: huge interest around sustainability and decreasing exposure of different things, there's so much big data, there is a lot of aaplication of ml, there is  a lot of need to write thigns and be proficient with js to play in that sandbox, I say js because my brother is software exec and he's been part of some start ups that did some text to data work, they would analyze whole twitter feed and do cool things like predict primaries and election results based on twitter comments and word associations, what positive thigns are said about candidates, relate to GPS tag, etc, that's all based on js, it's flexible, you can do backend, data, and front end all with js",
