Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"three things, chief engineer, building free tool that students get o do things, makes things easier for teaching, on the side, nonprofit, work at schools to add entreprenuership, now we hire people, designing cirricula for other schools base don what they figured out, also: work in seatle, makes tech that's useful for other companies, train people, and do outreach + hiring; ","free tool that lets teachers individualize the learning for students; run a non-profit designing curriculum and helping schools; company in seattle does tech interviews for other tech company, trains interveiwers"
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","interesting place: worked at school, like Olin for high schoolers, basically two weeks sprint where you coach students through coding, sort of like engineering for hummanity, student looked at how a concussion affects your hearing, made a program where you hear everything with a second or half second delay; schools we work with in Oakland, tech literacy isn't there, figuring out style to teach; worked at Wellsley, worked a lot w/ scratch and computing, another school: bring in programming; while at Olin: team in Boston had experiences they hoped to get to people what engineering means, how to design experiences that explain how these different disciplines, they brought in computer engineering","Olin as a high school, taught there for a while after graduating, engineering for humanities, simulated how consussion affects hearing, this was a one-off sort of project; ""how do you help students understand it?"", it being computer engneering"
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,"I'm a software engineer, I code every day",codes everyday
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"find myself enjoying interviewing people a lot more, probably leaning towards that, how to assess coding skills in warm and effective way; don't think my current job can get more computational, currently manager; but design pattern could get computational",enjoys the engineering side more; doesn't think current job can get more computational (product engineering?)
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","MATLAB, kinda loved it and hated it, got first software internship never having coded, got hired as analyst, then instead ended up being software engineer, had to pretend to know how to code, lots of bad practice, 3 other internships were in software, learned the most, took Olin js and that was really applied, think classes like FOCS I'm now appreciating and SoftDes now that I can apply them, got things out of classes like softdes and FOCS, but not on coding side, graduated class of 2016","MATLAB - hated it; got his first software internship without actually learning how to code. They wouldn't hire him for software because he didn't know how to code, hired him for different position, then changed their minds and put in a software enineering position. Had 3 other software engineering interships. A lot of the applied classes gave him knowledge (not on the ""me coding"" side) that he now sees as very useful, didn't at the time"
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,"before Olin: zero, after Olin: definitely through job, construction project at wellesley breaking down coding, designing experience that's the same for all of them, computational thinking, what is the core of this, learned a lot about how to understand people and how I talk about coding","nothing before Olin; after Olin, a lot from jobs, thinking through and understanding where other people are and how to talk about coding"
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","depends on age that you're talking about, only ever worked under high school, for them it's important to start with knowledge, understanding what it is gives you the chance to apply it, knowledge and understanding; undergrad: probably skills, think what works for Olin and for me: doing something where you know how you can apply it, you get to apply different computing concepts that you're learning","depends on the age, only ever work under high school -- focus on knowledge, they just need to understand what it is; undergrad probably skill, want to understand how you can apply it"
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"in general: problem solving skills, disposition that is hard working, but not hard on themselves, understand things don't go well and you push through it, asking for helpComputing side: breaking down complex problems, can simplify things to one things, two things, three things, that's a skill that's coming to mind, helped you: doing lots of interviews, most of the jobs I've had have been much more people looking for specific thing and they find me, I got connected because of passion of project or something, like getting hired from POE project; got hired from POE project: a machine that writes with a fountain pen, lots of companies based it on our design, got lots of emails about it, one guy was really persistent, this guy ended up wanting to hire us, got a team at Olin to work for him, other things within education: often get people who need these specific skills and find me, the thing that's gotten me the most jobs is talking about what I do a lot","general -- probelm solving skills, disposition thats hard working but not too hard on themselves; computing -- being able to ask for help, breaking down complex probelms"
,,"other thing that's helped a lot: asking so much, small talk with company, then want to do more work","what helped you in getting jobs? doing lots of interviews; most of the jobs have been referrals or they were looking for something specific and found him, like getting hired off his POE project (caligraphy writing machine!), just recently was the first month they didn't receive an email asking to hire him for it or to rebuild it, talking about what he does a lot"
,,"for everyone: understand computational thinking, not the same as coding, people should see why its cool, Olin does a good job of this, but doesn't give it a name; computional thinking: like when you're thinking through how you're going to code something, thinking through how to compute a set of data, type of thinking you do when you're coding, helps you break down problems, psuedo code is a really good example, not knowing any specific language, just understanding fundamnetals of coding",other thing thats helped a lot is asking the company a lot
,,technology studio,"computational thinking -- not the same as coding, it's really cool, that's important to understand; when you're thinking through how you would compute something, that thought process is computatioanl thinking -- not limited to just coding"
