,Questions,Ever,Lydia
Background,Have you taken SoftDes?,yes,
,What was the deciding factor for taking it or not taking it? Or choosing to take it later?,"wanted to do e: with c, didn't want to take softdes, instead wnated to test out, but couldnt and took it, deciding factor was laziness and wnating to learn python",
Skills,Can you describe a time you used computation outside of software?,analyzing data at work: my job: analyzing data on autonmous car performance,
,Can you tell us about any experiences you've had learning software outside of class?,"started learning programming on my own in high school, home schooled so it wasn't a class officially, so it was me findign things to do, i found an ebook on java and spent a month or so working thorugh it, and taught myself java and web development stuff by playing with things, building some websites, lots of random finding stuff online, most structure before olin was that ebook that was a good introduction, made website for dad's bussiness and someone heard I could do tech stuff and started being a website person",
Practicality,"Could you tell us about a time where computation would have been useful, but you didn’t have the skills at the time?","wouldve been more relevant when getting started, originally tried programming ipod touch in 8th grade, but didnt have good resource for doing so, it was a score tallier thing, it was my first attempt and it wasn't really structured at all, there was no structure for that and it didn't go very far, but the year after I learned java with the book; yes at Olin: feel like when I'm learning something in class doing math and applying it programmatically... (trailed off), I think in OARS we wanted to do computer vision for detecting obstacles -> we brought it Will to do it",
Topics (if taken SoftDes),"If you’ve taken SoftDes, is there any topic in software you’d like to explore further after taking the class?","one thing that should be taught is software architecture: how do you write code that's structured and written well, which is a little more the next level after softdes, learn to code better and with other people in a coherent manner, I wanna learn more about machine learning, its data science which has a fair amount of overlap with software",
,"If you took SoftDes, are there any software topics you explored further after taking the class?","did one of the toolboxes (ai path planning) and that's come back up at OARS ( a star), it came up in DSA, planning paths, python",
Considerations,"If you’ve taken SoftDes, are you interested in learning more advanced software topics after taking the class?","yes, data science, which encompasses machine learning, i guess complexity science: analyzing runtime of things, like how quickly something runs with different amounts of users, O(n) notation, haven't conducted thorough search of classes I can take, so I take things that sound cool",
,What would keep you from taking a SoftDes follow up class?,"me personally, not graduation requirements, if you were like a meche probably you would be held back by reqs, having already done a lot of what was going to be taught in the class",
,,"""They want to know your thoughts on computing at Olin"" ""It certainly happens"" ",
,,"more feedback on code style and implementation, structuring would be really helpful, for people developing skills, probably make more",
,,"writing clean code, strucutred code, help them personally with skills, and also job prospects, if companies could see that we have strong code structuring and coding skills, it would be good, need to know how to do it, not just hacking things together, film production worthy code is very valuable, also workign with teams understanding conventions, how things are structured, how to document things well to convey them, thats the level after softdes I feel, talking about how hypothetical application you're doing would be structured, not writing code, but writing out logic of structure, and it's an easy short way of practicing and getting feedback withotu writing code yet, feel like that would be a good exercise",
