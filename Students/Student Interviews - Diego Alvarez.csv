,Questions,Ever,Lydia
Background,Have you taken SoftDes?,no,no
,What was the deciding factor for taking it or not taking it? Or choosing to take it later?,couldnt fit it into schedule and also I'm a meche so it was lower priority; would have taken it if you could fit it in; coding is a less useful skill than something like mechproto,"couln't fit in schedule, also a mech:e so low in priority. would have taken if fit in schedule. as compared to taking other classes, it's less useful than taking mechproto; it is useful, however"
Skills,Can you describe a time you used computation outside of SoftDes?,"yes? did modsim entirely in matlab which was interesting, i never used anything else so I cant compare it to python, but it was rough at first, ive grown to love matlab becasue of qe; my modsim final project in matlab: Nick and I modeled gravity of spaceship in binary star system, generated binary star system and threw a spaceship at it","modsim entierly in matlab (""interesting""); nothing to compare it too -- it was a little rough at first, but he figured it out, learned to love matlab because of QEA. ModSim final project -- modeling gravity of spaceship through binary space system (basically 2 stars)"
,Can you tell us about any experiences you've had learning software outside of class?,"last summer I taught myself python using the internet, just like basic stuff, nothing super complicated; it was okay, learning for the first time was a little weird, Ive used an arduino before so I knew a little bit where i was like, I knew things like what an if statement was, but you were forced to learn it anyway, now that I think about it: there aren't a lot of resources for people who arent programers who want to learn more programming and aren't completely new","last summer taught himself python through the interenet, just basic stuff; it was okay, but weird, he's used Arduino before so he already knew some of the things that were being coverd online. Aren't a lot of resources for people who aren't programming people, but aren't completely new to programming."
Practicality,"Could you tell us about a time where computation would have been useful, but you didn’t have the skills at the time?","ooh, uhhh, umm... probably last summer, doing some automation work, built mechanism just fine, but program wasnt elegant and caused issures down the road, it was basically taking athread and cutting certain lengths from it, I didnt have a good way of knowing how long the thread was going to be, all i really could do was approximate and trial and error figure out how to get thread i want","""ooh,um...ahhhh"" last summer, doing some automation work, program worked, but wasn't elegant and that caused issues down the road -- program was for cutting off certain lengths of thread, lack of knowledge about the electrical side of things"
Topics (if taken SoftDes),"If you’ve taken SoftDes, is there any topic in software you’d like to explore further after taking the class?","any topics youd llike to explore? just like intermediate topics in software in general, ml would be cool, if i could fit it into schedule i would take it","intermediate level topics in general; doesn't know enough programming to narrrow down to a specific topic; ""what would you think about a machine learning class?"" ""that would be cool"" ""wait, really?"" would take if he could fit in schedule"
,"If you took SoftDes, are there any software topics you explored further after taking the class?","asides from learning python, not really, used python in POE, but Kyle was really doing all the computational stuff, but i helped mach up something in python, also used it at my job that summer; used python for thread cutting machine on raspy","nothing aside from learning python on his own; used it in POE -- mock up these programs in python, other mech:e's were like ""what?"", he was like ""cool!""; also used it at summer job (thread cutting machine)"
Considerations,"If you’ve taken SoftDes, are you interested in learning more advanced software topics after taking the class?",yeah i dont thin ki can answer that question,can't answer that question
,What would keep you from taking a SoftDes follow up class? (Or a completely separate programming class?),time,"time, having to find time in his schedule that would leave him alive at the end of the semester"
,,"2 cr class for coding: it sounds like youve identified a need, im not in that group, but i could see that being useful","2 cr class focused on people who suffered with SoftDes: not part of that need group, but thinks that would definitly be useful for that group"
,,"talk to andrew, cs education is his thing","definitely talk to Andrew -- double majoring in CS and Education, has lots of opinions about cs education (also going to japan with him at the end of the summer)"
,,"i kinda wanna take softdes at some point, like sr yr, ill be satisfied with that","kind of want to take softdes, would be satisfied with what he would learn from that (what would like to have learned about software/computing by the time you graduate Olin?); put off to sr yr, need the mech:e classes more than the software classes in order to get internships"
,,"wanna try and get internships over summer, and for meche position, its good to have mechproto more than it is to have softdes",
