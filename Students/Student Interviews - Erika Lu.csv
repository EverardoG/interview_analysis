,Questions,Ever,Lydia
Background,Have you taken SoftDes?,REALLY EVER?? (yes),yes
,What was the deciding factor for taking it or not taking it? Or choosing to take it later?,"it seemed like the next class to take for my major; excited about computing; knew interested before olin; coding before olin: took some programming classes in high school: took python class sr yr, and built xbox games","next class to take for major (); excited about computing, knew before Olin about excitement. took a couple programming classes in hs; python class sr yr (all sr yr), and programming xbox games (C#)"
Skills,Can you describe a time you used computation outside of software?,"i didn't write this: one of my friends wrote a fan fiction and she was embarrassed about it, so we came up with key words in her fan fiction, and scraped the web to find it, we read it aloud on the bus back from robotics; did a summer camp where little kids programmed lego robots, but that was the extent of robotics programming for me","string parser, friend said they wrote a fanfic and was embarrassed about it, so they came up with keywords that friend might have included and scraped to try to find it. summer camp where little kids programmed robots, extent of programming for robotics"
,Can you tell us about any experiences you've had learning software outside of class?,"first week of internship: made website on heroku, second week did string parsing for hexadecimal that airplanes; programming a gui for can messaging, it monitors a type of message called can; that's honestly been the biggest project; nathan and I have been working on making games in Unity; learned a bit of ROS on IARC, but forgot it","made a website on slac (deployed on heroku) first week of internship, second week work on string parser for airplanes (hexadecimal), been working on a gui for messaging. nathan and her have been working on Unity - making games. learned a bit of ROS from IARC, but forgot it real quick"
Practicality,"Could you tell us about a time where computation would have been useful, but you didn’t have the skills at the time?","if i knew about excel map roads earlier, budeting would have been easier, excel macros; desire to make apps: I want a project, so i wouldn't say my end goal was to make an app, more about exploring what I could do, and I have too much free time after work and it gets lonely :(, also I relax by programming",excel macros for budgeting - would have been easier if she'd known them earlier
Topics (if taken SoftDes),"If you’ve taken SoftDes, is there any topic in software you’d like to explore further after taking the class?","yes, data structures: also wanna throw this idea out there: softdes gives you a lot of freedom to choose how you wanna code something, so it could be a good thing to give oliners a common interview question and have them set out to make the most efficient program to do it, that way: they;ll be learning basic data structures on their own: that would give more ownership over ds content that an education outside olin would give them","data structures! what softdes does well is give you freedom to choose how you want to code something; since Oliners are competitive, give them an interview question and have them setout to come up with the best program for that question, so they'll learn wht they need to know but still have ownership of it"
,"If you took SoftDes, are there any software topics you explored further after taking the class?","saw people using flask for their projects, and so at my internship, i was idle for aweek, and i asked if a website would be useful, and then spent a week looking into that; webdev at Olin? not really, would want something less narrow than that","saw people using flask for their projects, so during idle week at internship looked more into flask; 'have web dev class at olin?' no, want something less narrow"
Considerations,"If you’ve taken SoftDes, are you interested in learning more advanced software topics after taking the class?","""nope I'm done with it"" ""in all seriousness, yeah I'm gonna continue""","""Nope, I'm done with it"" in all seriousness, she's going to continue with this"
,What would keep you from taking a SoftDes follow up class?,"honestly it depends on the alternative, i assume data structures would be the follow up; hoping follow up is data structures, feel like a lot of programming is you given an end goal and you look up whats up there, im more interested in an open ended class like softdes; i wouldnt be interested in class that teaches you proper etiquite for python would feel like too much; what if it was after software design? honestly that should be part of data structures","depends on the alternative; do you mean data structures? what do you mean? (hopes follow up is data structures); if given a class specifically on web dev, would be less interested. class that focuses on good programming practices: wouldn't take that as her first class; would be overwhelming when learning first language; after softdes, it should hoenstly be part of data structures"
,,"I really like software design being the first class, I'm working with someone who took a traditional software course, they were learning very structured stuff, but because of that she absorbed it more like a science rather than a toolkit, she doesn't know about the tools because she didn;t have the time to go online and search for things, didn't find use cases for all these things, she built in a lot of things on her own, data structures aren't taught at all in softdes, but i think for trying to get people interested in software, olin does it very well","she wants a project (currently making random Ruby bot), end goal wasn't necesarily to make an app, just wanted to explore what she can do and has a lot of free time; relaxes from programming by doing free-time programming XD"
,,"since data strcutures is so improtant for getting employed; it feels like lots of job interviews: they ask how efficient code is and things like that, I would like maybe a toolkit or something on data structures","likes software design to be the first class; working with someone who took classical software class, very data science like, so the person absored it as a science rather than a tool. dtat structures arent raelly touched on at all but they're very important. for trying to get peopl einterested in computing, Olin does  a good job"
,,,want it because it's very import for job prospects - interviewers will ask about code efficiency and such
,,,data structures very important
