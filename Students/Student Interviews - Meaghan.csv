,Questions,Ever,Lydia
Background,Have you taken SoftDes?,yes,
,What was the deciding factor for taking it or not taking it? Or choosing to take it later?,"freshman who knew nohting about nothing, didnt know if i liked coding yet, thought it was possible, also when i took modsim it was terrible, thought I would do better in straight up coding class",
Skills,Can you describe a time you used computation outside of software?,"mostly matlab, pretty much every class uses it for something, for research this summer iw as getting it to do math, used it regularly in mechsolids, QEA used it constantly; because there's three of us working over the summer, one of my teammates picked up the role, i don't know if I need to learn coding in a different way or if it just isn't my thing",
,Can you tell us about any experiences you've had learning software outside of class?,"yes -> summer between jr and sr year in high school, class in community college, where if you checked blackboard every once in a while, you'd get confused email the teacher and get no response, nobody knew anything about coding, no friends ro family who knew, having a person to talk to is super hlepful, don't really know the language, wish we had a debugging class, don't know how to make it work , just put print statements, would want good coding technique class, wish softdes would give people code that doesn't work, then you have to debug it and show your porcess for debugging it, they show you how they would have done it, or maybe say  what steps you missed, biuld off what you did, more just showing you basic debugging techniques, this assumes they dont know much about debugging, i feel like my experience: coding isn't hard, debugging is hard",
Practicality,"Could you tell us about a time where computation would have been useful, but you didn’t have the skills at the time?","so many, first one i thougth of was mechsolids: take home test with four questions where each one was insane, you had to make it into a program and answer it, I eventually went a head and did a tiny experiemnt for myself, programming was a crucial thing you had to know that you were being tested on that; haven't been through that many meche specific classes, just starting junior yer where they get more specific, my current job is all meches, yet coding is such a massive part fo it that one of our people has become ",
Topics (if taken SoftDes),"If you’ve taken SoftDes, is there any topic in software you’d like to explore further after taking the class?",,
,"If you took SoftDes, are there any software topics you explored further after taking the class?","so much was so over my head that i didnt know what we were doing or what i was usppposed to be getting out of it, it was more just like I didnt know anything that was happening, I went to NINJA hours, I emailed professors, I got more and more confused as they pointed at whiteboard code and stuff, the very first day was way over my head, softdes is a prereq so we have people who know nothing and the profs didn't know what it was like to know nothing, wanted to have a separate class for real beginners, frustrated by them hitting this middle ground that they couldn't hit properly, confused peopel were over their head and good people were really bored; not sure our version of modsim was great: matlab is linear algebra based and no one knew that going into modsim; i would really like a class focused on begginner software, olin has a really bad concept of what knowing nothing is like, basics of electronics was somethign I had just learned the summer before, you had to know all these things, like calculating energy in hopper, ""Im really cautious of what this school's version of knowing nothing is""; on one hand , more familiar with matlab, I like windows, like to use matlab in windows, softdes is all in ubuntu, if you come to things that you can use everywhere, like python, that's helpful, idea of applicability vs ease of use/ familiarity",
Considerations,"If you’ve taken SoftDes, are you interested in learning more advanced software topics after taking the class?","it was more what, what, what's going on? in softdes; interest in software/ computation more towards specifc things or general: more in general, a skill in my backpocket, more about being able to do it so i can tell an employer",
,What would keep you from taking a SoftDes follow up class?,"probably what I can fit into my course load, as somebody going into jr year, space is getting pretty tight, it would be hard not to take a class you need to graduate, but I know I need to know it, so i might find away to wrangle it into my schedule, plus its  a psychological thing: set yourself up thinking ""im gonna do bad in this class""",
,,"""Coding is a literacy like reading or writing that you need to know these days""",
,,"coding for machines is very meche based coding, people who know how to code wouldnt count it though",
,,"difficulty of coding goes up and you get left in the dust, I'm still looking into basics, I would not call what I do very facny efficient or working code, I know its a skill that I have to learn",
