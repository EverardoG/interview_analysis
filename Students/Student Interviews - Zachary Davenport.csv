,Questions,Ever,Lydia
Background,Have you taken SoftDes?,no,
,What was the deciding factor for taking it or not taking it? Or choosing to take it later?,"so primary times i was looking at taking softdes when I had a feeling other classes weren't going to be offered much longer, decided to take engineering for humanity instead since I knew it wouldn't be taught much longer, now I've got all these requirements, if you're a meche and you dont take it your first year, it quickly falls off your radar; class youd like to take? so, if i could fit it in to my schedule and it maybe got a revamp, I would love to get more coding experience while at Olin, but how, when and among all the other things I already do; when i heard about the new class you guys are making, thats super cool, but ive already got my 4 year plan solidly cemented so now theres this other class but at the sacrifice of what, its not that I wouldnt like to do it, but just finding out how; 2 cr coding class? could be useful and good idea, interesting thing is how theyre structured, sometimes a 4cr class for the first half, or 2 cr class for whole semester and feels more like a co cirricular, more in favor of spread out through semester, like a student led vehicle design class that was 2 cr class that was 4 cr class first half semester, and then you get to the point of running people super thin, especially for me as a meche, I wanna be able to commit time to coding, wanna spread work evenly through semester; ",
Skills,Can you describe a time you used computation outside of SoftDes?,"didnt take it; as a person taking QEA, there was plenty of that, but hten one crazy thing QEA did for me, also olin as a whole, taught me doing math on a computer, after going through crash course of modsim in matlab, i sort of understood it, helped to have those skills in QEA, then there was something I wanted to answer on my own and wrote my own thing in matlab; all this stuff i wouldnt have done at all that I did because I have the tools and knowledge to do it; during break: getting oil changed at a jiffy lube, and i did research on collatz conjecture, and basically start with any positive integer, then [insert math here], i made this beautiful plot of how colatz conjecture works",
,Can you tell us about any experiences you've had learning software outside of class?,"common trend: if i wanna learn something about programming, Ill just go ahead and do it real quick, first year second semseter, I realized i gotta learn how to make a website so i could do a portfolio, so i learned basics of html5, and live building a website, so that was cool, I learned arduino in POE, confusing at first, because I knew matlab, mathematica and a tiny bit of html, and then i learned what a normal programming language looks like, and then I felt reasonably competent in it moving into project part, knowing arduinoC blows my mind a bit, learned a tiny bit of python for random things at olin, every oliner knows at least a little bit of pyhon it seems like",
Practicality,"Could you tell us about a time where computation would have been useful, but you didn’t have the skills at the time?","think that bayesian example is a good one, I'd just come out of poe with a tiny bit of python, then i was confused with that assumption that we knew how to do it, there was a time when kyle and I were sitting in my dorm and we were comparing random number generation between matlab and python, and it was like I was plotting a measurement of randomness of numbers in matlab, and kyle did it in half the lines in python, i know a way to do things, but not the better way to do things, efficiently computing, elegant coding; if class is only focused on good code practices, it could be a 2 cr class combined with practical applications of coding, coding for the common man, if you have just a 2cr class on how to document code, that could get tedious after a while; code reviews? could be interested, it would certainly help you get better, a lot of times when someones code looks like a foreign language is because i get basics bu tthere are functions that ive never heard of a lot of things in the language, could be a useful way of learning things that you couldnt learn on your own; collaborating effecrtively on code could be somethign super good for oliners to learn; lots of upperclassmen held session on github impromptu, but like it was useful, knowing how to use github on big important projects is important, actually knowing how github works, actually knowing how to use git is good",
Topics (if taken SoftDes),"If you’ve taken SoftDes, is there any topic in software you’d like to explore further after taking the class?",,
,"If you took SoftDes, are there any software topics you explored further after taking the class?",,
Considerations,"If you’ve taken SoftDes, are you interested in learning more advanced software topics after taking the class?",,
,What would keep you from taking a SoftDes follow up class? (Or a completely separate programming class?),,
,,"it seems like python is a go to language for lots of things, like sanjoy assuming everybody knows python in bayes, its kind of an assumption that oliners know python",
,,"next two years: weird meche in that i did lots of normal general reqs first, got em out of the way, dont have as many meche core, it allowed me to take classes i really wanted to take, which was kind of sacrifice in the end to do what I wanted in the beginning, if you look at 4 yr plan, there are blocks open for ahs stuff, and maybe one more thing open sr yr, but for the most part i feel like i have things planned out, which is why a 2 cr class is useful, 18 crediting is not bad",
,,"also worth thinking about if somebody takes this on, want to guage interest in why people are taking it, good to know if this will be the first thing on the copping block for dropping, one of the reasons people stick with project teams is because it offers good experience and its practical, you see return on time you invested because this thing is coming to life, some classes are structured like that, people have autonomy, but its different; not sure trying to make this like a project team is a good idea, but looking at things that people get commited to -> can you add that ot a class to keep people engaged",
,,"0:robo OCRA -> first year winter break I was sitting in dollar theater and get text from arpan asking me to join him doing battlebots, but i didnt know how to code, and he was like you can figure it out, so i was like maybe in a year or two, so idea of battlebots was cool and appealing, but the way it was first thrown at me was a bit much, having thought it over more it sounds cool",
,,"im already spread pretty thin, so throwing in a 2 cr class really sounds like a lot",
