,Questions,Ever,Lydia
Background,Have you taken SoftDes?,no,
,What was the deciding factor for taking it or not taking it? Or choosing to take it later?,"I think its because the meche curriculum is notorious for being really intensive with regards to requirements, so i thought that I could save softdes for sr yr as a pass fail class, also given that meches need to know matlab, and python is not required, that's been a big motivator",
Skills,Can you describe a time you used computation outside of SoftDes?,"computation at Olin? matlab is something I use in meche classes, started off with modsim and that was a little difficult because I had never programmed before, and in conjunction with a lot of mild to high level math and application i dont think i was ready for application step yet, I was still learning what it means to program, but everyone else moved pretty fast, I felt like meche classes were pretty simple in terms of computation, and now I'm in a better place there; so mostly I dont really need so many functions in matlab that are difficult to understand, in general its a straightforward calculation that doesn't require a lot of knowledge of programming, its formulas where you set variables equal to what they should be, generally the breadth of waht i do, taht gives me insights to fundamentals of coding an dstarting from teh ground up; going back to the basics, definitely learned cool stuff in modsim and more advanced computation, but yeah going back to basics",
,Can you tell us about any experiences you've had learning software outside of class?,"first thing that comes to mind is modsim: that was a bit difficult, a lot of people have a coding background, and that class definitely moved in favor of those who knew a lot of coding, there were these quizes that we did taht were intermittent 20 minute coding snippets, half my table finished in 5 minutes, i would use the full 20, a lot of them knew how to code, and what it meant to code, how matlab works, etc, so it wasnt very confidence inducing experience, then I guess the most recent experience I had was mathematica for PDEs; nobody really knew what was going on, so it felt not so bad, I was on the same playing field as everyone else, in general it wasn't as crazy modsim with regards to disparities in knowledge; giving time to let learning settle and to let imposter syndrome go away, lots of coding is just looking up functions, didn't realize taht until end of first year",
Practicality,"Could you tell us about a time where computation would have been useful, but you didn’t have the skills at the time?","at Olin we have a lot of computation tools available to us, I guess its always available, but we dont always know how to use them, especially with mathematica, lots of people didnt even know it existed, there was this thought that we only had matlab, but olin has subscriptions to all these cool things that they don't go off to teach, so QEA kids got intro to mathematica, but lin kids didn't; lin1 wouldve been useful to use some mathematica for visualizations of linear systems and such but didnt know how",
Topics (if taken SoftDes),"If you’ve taken SoftDes, is there any topic in software you’d like to explore further after taking the class?",,
,"If you took SoftDes, are there any software topics you explored further after taking the class?",,
Considerations,"If you’ve taken SoftDes, are you interested in learning more advanced software topics after taking the class?",,
,What would keep you from taking a SoftDes follow up class? (Or a completely separate programming class?),,
,,"i think maybe a co curricular or seminar in the space of helping people who are knew to coding maintain that sort of rush they got from omdsim, and continuing skills ore recalling them at least, and being really explicit about it being for new coders, if you make it a code really fancy epxerienced coders will join and it defeats the purpose; 2 cr class could be helpful, I think that would work, maybe having some partnership between lin and 2 cr course could be helpful, it could supplement lin, mechproto can be difficult in terms of time consumption, adding to workload because you're not a good coder isn't fair, being aware of workload is critical",
,,"think i would want to emphasize the not giving too much of an extra workload to new coders, doesn't seem right to make it a punishment for people falling behind, that could be problematic, in terms of actual content: its an interesting thing because software people would lean towards python while meches would lean towards matlab, with your year you guys have switched over to python completely, i think it would be especially important to meches to learn about matlab, just being careful of giving everybody what they want, make sure you're doing something thats useful for everyone",
,,"i think to start, maybe an overview of some of the stuff we did in modsim would be helpful, my first vacation after first semester was wow i did a lot of coding, and for me that was helpful but Im not sure if thats the same fore veryone else, i think that maybe it would be best to leave it as an open ended kind of project based thing, so everybody can work at their own pace, in a timeline they feel comfortable with, modsim was very strict with deadlines: if you're falling behind too bad; doesn't leave room for really getting to know what you're doing, a lot of the time i had to look up answers to get it working, in the end i didn't fully understand it, leaving everyone to go at their own pace would be good",
,,"think projects that are relevant to things like lin or mechanics could be cool, using matlab as a really helpful tool for those classes, maybe some cool animations for projectile motion, or with regards to some matrix manipulation, some cool eigenvector functions that wouldve been cool to know a year ago",
,,"mechanics -> no matlab, lin -> wasnt required, but a lot of us did cool stuff with matlab for final projects, i just got a cool project where i did SVD, it was cool to use matlab to figure out how to do this sort of decomposition of the image, looking up functions, making that task mine, doing it at a timeline that I felt appropriate, i think i learned seom stuff by doing that",
,,"dont remember snippets of code being required in lin, but there were recommended try things in matlab sort of things",
,,"working together has helped us out a lot, but a little udnerserved",
