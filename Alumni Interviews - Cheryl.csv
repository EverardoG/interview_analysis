,Questions,Ever Notes,Lydia Notes
Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"moved to different job, right now I'm at a start up kind of, about 25 employees, sinle processing, image processing, deep learning work related to that, lots of python, tensorflow; other jobs: mostly MATLAB","moved to new job, kind of a startup 25 employees, single processing, image processing, deep learning, been using python tensor flow; have done mostly MATLAB in previous jobs, mainly for simulation work, performance analysis, visualization/graphs, not too much handling numbers, some GUIs; MATLAB licenses expensive, if you can do it in python for free, why not. used Julia in grad school, was unfinished at the time, but very fast, feels similar to MATLAB and python"
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","some simluation work, worked on radar system before, performance analysis, making plots, not too much in terms of numerical, some GUIs, feel like MATLAB is kind of like falling out of favor, python is gaining more ground; working with MATLAB at Raytheon, working with Python for smaller company because it's free; Julia? -> programming language, felt unfinished when I used it, not language of choice, really fast, feels similar to matlab and python",
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,"doing a lot of tensorflow, some of it we have preprocessing it, numpy, a lot of geometrical calculations, large volumes of data, speed is desirable; learned about: numba -> acclerates python code, apparently that's a good tool for speeding up things, can write a naive for loop and it can recognize it and speed it up, pypy -> another accelerator","doing a lot of tensor flow, has some pre-processing (numpy), geometric processing with alot of data, numba? can speed up things a lot (can recognize a naive for loop)?, pipy? another accelerator"
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"there are a lot of libraries in this area, this job is becoming more and more high level where you can rely on libraries; computational thinking in job: somethign I think related: I took a course in gradschool, computational linear algebra, covered things like catastrophic calculations, how you can get bad answers, round off errors, run into errors in code where i should've used float64 instead of float32, something I am lacking in my background is design patterns: like if you have a formal cs background, know how to write algorithm, don't know how to do good software design, also related is version control: course in grad school: github was part of the class, learned how to use github, important part of programming professionally, used it as a feedback, something where we could share it and they put comments in our assignments","many different deep learning libraries, many people working on making it more user friendly, so current job is becoming mrore high-level and just using libraies for implementation; took a course in grad school, maybe computational thinking; not familiar with design patterns, since background is not in cs, as well as source control -- both important, especially source control"
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","no thinking to work in computational field, got hired a systems engineer for raytheon, took Intro to Software Design by Allen Downey, was a regular course, was at 8 am, graduated in 06, took nothing else at Olin; had requirement on first day: read 3 chapters of matlab abd do some matlab stuff, general amount of matlab exposure everyone got; just had on the job experience, got al ot from reading other people's matlab code, learned how to make guis that way, wish I'd leanred the same thing in python, have some foundation in python, but in terms of doing things in clever or pythonic way just trying, team has a real software developer and he's been really helpful","wasn't thinking of going into computational space when at Olin, was doing more high level thinking; took intro to software design with Allen Downey (graduated 2006), that was it; there were some assignments related to software (read these chapters on MATLAB, then do some things in MATLAB); just had on-the-job learning, mainly learning by reading other people's code, learned how to make GUIs in MATLAB that way; has a ""real"" software devloper on team, so they've been a big help"
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,"didn't know anything before coming to Olin, took a C++ course where we didn't write any code :(, took programming for engineering courses in post grad, the intro course was python, maybe al ittle bit of C++?, tried to teach me good design, more theoretical, figuring out what could go wrong when handling lots of data was super helpful","nothing prior to Olin (book thing?); after Olin, took computation courses aimed at engineers (not cs people), more theoretical, more on what can go wrong when handling large sets on data"
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","definitely the skills, kinda interesting where I'm at, learned so much on the job about the tools, constantly learning content at work, apply same concepts, but different tools, core ideas are the same, people thought that was not a big deal","definitely the skills; some days she learns so much on the job, she wonders how she got hired here; different tools, but the core ideas are the same, so that's what was important to the people hiring her"
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"trying to hire a lot of people -> ideally: people who are good at Python, know how to program, know git, more important: being really interested in learning new things, being adaptable, technology is evolving at such a fast pace, papers coming out every day on deep learning, if we have to change things up, we can, I guess a skill that you could practice is just being able to figure out how to do something when it isn't working","currently trying to hire; ideally good at python, know Git, know how to program, being really interested in earning new things, being adaptable (MOST IMPORTANT); tech advancing at such a fast rate, might have change things up, rewrite model using different techniques; being able to change approach when things aren't working"
,,"masters program: after Olin, ended up working for 7 or 8 years before getting master, ICME at Stanford, loved about the program that they focused on general math skills, optimization ,markov chains, you pick a field: finance, geo enviroemental engineering, thermo, waterflow, etc and you learn some computational skills that apply to those fields, some of these courses that aren't full on computer science that are broadly applicable; i had a little background with radar, took a few more classes with radar, imaging of ground, picture using data from satellite","after Olin (master's program) called ICME at Stanford -- loved the focus: general math skills; pick a field (fiannace, envirnmental engineering, thermodynamics), just learn these computaional mathematical skills that relate to your focus, had background in radar (had worked at radeon)"
