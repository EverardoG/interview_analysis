,Questions,Ever Notes,Lydia Notes
Their job,Where do they work?  How long have they been there?  Are they in management or an individual contributor?,"graduated in 2016, wcurrently grad student at MIT, work on marine robotic systems, more specifically on software, more intelligent, strongly support computing being a necessary skill, basic data processing, lots of work with basic statistics, data streams come from chemical instruments or whatver, need those to be filtered, data filtering, statistical analysis, informative data",
How do they use computation,"Tell us a story about a time when you used computation in a job that you’ve had since you’ve been at Olin.
","literally all the time, most relevant: processing data for nearby waste water treatment plants, scientsits see if waste water is actually meeting policy standards, but are they having impact? , figuring out standards for waste to not affect environment too much, I ned to parse large datasets, need toa ppply statistical techniques: linear interpolation, more advanced things, need to know if that's a good fit; split time between data science, more approachable form of computing, but a lot of time spent with autonomy or algorithms, data stream with no knowledge of environment, ",
,How do you utilize computation in your work?,,
,Do you anticipate your job becoming more (or less) computational over time?  Why?,"interesting-> trajectory of academic is to go more and more to project manager, having and practicing good compjutation will become more and more important for me, I could imagine doign tools doign a lot of the data sceiecn I do daily, that's gonna be more improtatn for more peopel alter on, designing algorithms will not be outsourced as much to tools",
Experience with Computing at Olin and Elsewhere,"While at Olin, describe the learning experiences you had (both inside and outside of the classroom)","robotics concentration: part of it, spent more time on software electrical side, took all of Paul's classes, he started when I was there, took first version of compRobo, took his data science class, took softdes, took all robotics classes, all algorithm oriented + sensor data, took controls -> did lots of simuliations and modeling, modsim, and wireless principles w/ Sidhartten; worked in robolab, did lots of algorithm design, outside of class was mostly workign in that lab doing mostly controls, lots of image processing, honestly: hobbies have not been influenced by engineering at all, mostly building apps and web platforms that process data",
,Describe any other learning experiences related to computing you had either before entering Olin or since graduating.,"before: class taught in js and visual basic in high school, entire background, they were helpful for getting in the right mindset for logical thinking and implementation, how to write algorithm, how to write code to look at data, way of thinking is not as natural as probabl oter forms of communication, we've all practiced narratives, papers, reports, but that doesn't play out in all programming syntax, iguring out what it is wat ou want to say in programming is hard, then learning the tools needed to practice, that kind of stuff isn't natural to everyone, coputing is a black box that is really intimidating, the idea of typing somehting into a terminal andit just works iss intimidating, thinking through logic of how programming works is a bit too much to takei n at want; after: most of what I've learned is math, taken alot more fundamental math, that's ipmorved my computing skills much more than I would have anticipated especially when thinking of algorithms, they're proofs written in computer language, math in terms of intensive lin and stats, fundamental machine learning, picking out what things in bayesian are useful for ompmuting is difficult, robotics classes were focused on calssical theory in coputing, especially in robot motion planning, data filtering, these are things I'd been exposed to, but didn't get depth in, surprised by how much was out there ",
What skills do they look for in potential job candidates,"Skills versus content knowledge versus process
","have alot of opinions: think that it depends on end objective, if end obj is someone ready for workforce, even at low level, want them to feel confident, then skills based/ focused are a much more suitable alt than knowledge based; if you want students being exposed to cornerstones in comp theory: need knowledge based class, looking for this appeal: a lot of knowledge that on face value peopel would not take the class if it's advertised that way, ideal that everyone wants to converge for is teaching skills w/ knowledge, if supposed to be general purpose: skills focused is probably the right thing; ",
,What kind of skills/ knowledge do you want people you’re going to hire to have?,"logistically: would be nice if people had experience with version controlling on team projects, everyone kind of knows how to use git, but almost always it's used as a fancy control z, version controlling in collaborative setting is REALLY important, makes tracking things really nice, learnin to document is desperately needed, want almost everyone I work with software with to have; perspective: want them to be problem solvers, but they don't need to know everything, like they can read and understand what's going on; knowing how to collaborate + communicate + work with others",
,,"important that courses and objectives are clear and transparent, people need to know that skills are what people should focus on if it's a skill based class; teaching: hands on is good, but I thikn that there is a rigor to teaching computation that I haven't really seen, and I'm not sure if it's necessary; never used computers in hs class until halfway through, which was helpful for figuring out some thigns on your own, rigor of forcing yourself to go through practice many many times so that you know it, not someone on the internent, there's a sense of satisfaction people get by solving tings on their own; feedback is key, didn't realize how speical feedback is until left Olin, figure out how to use it, explicit times where feedback is invited, incorporate it into fixing something ",
,,"spent a few months at uber before it was eveil, learned a whole new programming language, learned C while at this job, did mostly saftey oriented work, always data processing, have to be a data scientists when working on robots, went to a lab to do ressearch on robots doing marine archeology, robot had flippers, did a lot of different things uder water, it could go into shipwrekcs and stuff like that",
,,"robo major: took all robo classes, then took classes oriented towards robotics i was interested in, like wireless controls, took as many software high level courses as possible, interested in doing sensor stuff, took controls because motion planning is important, i probably would have taken more low level software classes, just for expewrience of doing that, don't know if it would be useful now though, did feel a little lost, felt like there was a lot of knowledge missing, but no skills missing, taking advantage of independent studies is something i should've done, and I would recommend, but you need to know what you want to do already, chatting with profs",
,,"reiterate that mindest was most helpful, learnign syntax is the skill, is possible if you've practiced it before, collaborating is easier if you've dont it before, knowledge is difficult to get without being exposed to ideas, need experience reading real journals and stuff, adding technical rigor? not a bad idea, not sure how to do it elegantly, it is something to consider, knowledge can come in different form, exposes students to lots of different ideas and resources without being knowldege based",
